# Text to Morse Code Converter
This is a simple Python program that converts text to Morse code. It allows users to input text, and the program will output the corresponding Morse code for each letter. Non-letter characters are represented as [?].

## Features
- Converts text to Morse code.
- Handles non-alphabetic characters by displaying [?].
- Allows the user to exit the program by typing exit.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A file named morse_dict.py containing the Morse code dictionary.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have a morse_dict.py file, which contains the Morse code dictionary (this is referenced by the script).
3. Run the main.py file.
4. The program will prompt you to enter the text to convert to Morse code. Type the desired text, and it will output the equivalent Morse code.

### Example:

```bash
=== Text to Morse Code Converter ===
Type 'exit' to exit.

Enter the text to convert to Morse code: Hello
Text in Morse Code: .... . .-.. .-.. --- 

Enter the text to convert to Morse code: World
Text in Morse Code: .-- --- .-. .-.. -.. 

Enter the text to convert to Morse code: exit
Shutting down the converter. See you later!
